At first, it was only the rules of the game in computer science that had been researched and explored, instead of the part that was related to the natural science. Not until the 2060s did the scientists found that the law of the nucleus's movement was similar to the rules of the Game of Life, in which the annihilation of anti-matter in control acted best and scientists were able to receive the best energy using efficiency closest to the theoretical computation. So the rule is widely used in power and ammunition, but the completely huge grid, like the Chaos Matrix, was too bold. At last, noticeable results were gained though it stopped several times.
